                <h4>2. Bulletpitch: Investing Philosophy, Strategy & Criteria</h4>
                <p>Bulletpitch's philosophy is democratizing VC access through media. [2] The "Venture-Media" strategy involves: leveraging its newsletter for community and deal flow [3, 7]; community building via events and co-working [2, 3]; sourcing deals through applications and strong NYC founder connections [2, 3, 8]; and investing via the Bulletpitch+ syndicate. [4, 9] Criteria for Bulletpitch+ include Pre-seed to Seed+ stages and accredited investors. [5] The model creates a flywheel: media builds community and deal flow, which fuels the syndicate, and successful investments enhance the media platform. [3]</p>

                <h4>3. Recent Investments & Declared Rationale</h4>
                <p>Perlmutter has invested in ~10 startups via his syndicate. [3] Newsletter features often indicate initial interest. [7, 10] POSH was a favored investment, caught early through the platform. [6]</p>

                <p>Perlmutter shares insights via YouTube, Bulletpitch, and LinkedIn. Key themes: finding untapped distribution channels [8]; primacy of media & branding ("people invest in people") [6, 11]; shift from influencer to pay-to-play marketing [6]; AI's role in media (displacing some roles, human creativity remains key) [6]; and founder mindset (youth as a "superpower," leveraging strengths). [12, 13] His early work at Google Ideas on "Constitute" shows an interest in democratizing access through technology. [14]</p>

            <h2>II. Curated Webinar Questions</h2>
            <p>This section provides questions for the webinar, designed for an audience of pre-seed founders.</p>

            <h3>A. Stimulating Questions for the Entire Panel</h3>
            <h4>Moderator Guidelines & Introduction:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intros:</strong> We’ll start by having each of you introduce yourself, your firm (stage, focus, criteria), and something about your firm that might not be obvious from your website. Please keep it to your elevator intro (30 seconds or less). I’ll prompt each of you, but we’ll be going alphabetical by first name (Brent- you’re leading off!)</li>
                <li><strong>Be concise:</strong> Because of the limited time and size of the panel, try to keep thoughts, anecdotes, and responses concise. Pauses will allow other panels to jump into the conversations. I will prompt to tee up new topics or to dive into an existing topic.</li>
                <li><strong>Be conversational:</strong> We want the flow to feel conversational, so feel free to prompt a fellow panelist, follow up on someone’s point, and add your perspective on a topic.</li>
                <li><strong>Be contrarian:</strong> We’re looking to capture the diversity in investing approaches, criteria, and fundraising advice, so please jump in when you can contrast your approach or views to those of your fellow panelists.</li>
                <li><strong>Feel free to DM me in Zoom if you want to chime in, redirect topics, etc.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h4>General Pre-Seed Landscape & Founder Psychology:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Beyond the pitch deck, what's one subtle quality in a pre-seed founder that signals to you they have the resilience and vision to navigate the 'zero to one' journey, especially when you're often investing pre-product or pre-revenue?"</li>
                <li>"Many founders struggle with knowing if their idea is 'VC-backable' at the pre-seed stage. What's a key distinction you make between a great small business idea and a venture-scale opportunity this early on?"</li>
                <li>"Imposter syndrome is common among founders. From your experience, how have you seen the most successful pre-seed founders manage self-doubt while still projecting conviction to investors and early hires?" [12, 13]</li>
                <li>"The pre-seed stage is often about finding early signals of product-market fit with limited resources. What's the most creative or scrappy validation tactic you've seen a founder use successfully?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Market Trends & "Why Now?":</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"We're seeing various macro trends like the rise of AI, shifts in remote work, and evolving consumer behaviors. From your unique vantage point, what's one specific 'why now' that gets you most excited for pre-seed B2B or B2C opportunities in the next 12-18 months?"</li>
                <li>"Several of you have distinct approaches – 'venture-media,' 'thesis-led cultural analysis,' 'anti-thematic,' 'B2B SaaS specialization,' 'network-driven B2B.' How do you see these diverse strategies playing out in the current economic climate for pre-seed investing?"</li>
                <li>"Founders are often told to 'build what people want.' How do you advise founders to balance solving an immediate, acute pain point versus building for a larger, perhaps less obvious, future market opportunity you might see through your firm's research or network?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Investor-Founder Relationship & Value-Add:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"All your firms emphasize value beyond capital. Can each of you share a specific, non-obvious way your firm has operationally helped a pre-seed company that significantly inflected their trajectory?"</li>
                <li>"What's one piece of advice you often give pre-seed founders about selecting their *first* check investors, beyond just valuation and check size? What should they be optimizing for in that early partnership?"</li>
                <li>"How do you approach the balance of providing guidance versus letting founders make their own mistakes, especially when you're so deeply involved at the pre-seed stage?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fundraising & Pitching (Original Category):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"For founders who are pre-product or have very early traction, what are the most compelling ways to demonstrate potential and de-risk the investment for you?"</li>
                <li>"Cold outreach to VCs can be daunting. What's one thing a founder can do in a cold email or initial contact that genuinely makes you pause and want to learn more, given the volume you see?" [48]</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Founder Outreach & Prospecting (Getting the First Meeting):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"When reflecting on your recent investments, how did those founders initially get your attention? What about their first email, conversation, or touch point got you hooked? How might that translate to advice for founders raising capital?"</li>
                <li>"What are the red and green flags before and during your first conversation with a founder?"</li>
                <li>"Where can founders stand out besides your inbox?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Landing the Investment:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Many founders get their fundraising advice on social media, or model their fundraising based on the success of one or two outlier decacorns. Talk about some general fundraising misconceptions you often see, and what's a more realistic approach for the average pre-seed founder?"</li>
                <li>"When you have follow-up meetings and start diligence with a founder, what do you look for, and what advice would you give a founder to maximize their chances of success with your firm?"</li>
                <li>"What behaviors have killed a deal you were initially excited about?"</li>
                <li>"What’s the most memorable pitch you received and why?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>General Themes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"We’re seeing a lot of AI-native startups, not only in the products startups are building, but how they’re building their product, go-to-market, and every corner of their operations. Talk about how AI plays into your thesis and the bets you’re making."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>B. Targeted Questions for Individual Panelists</h3>
            <h4>Brett Perlmutter (Bulletpitch):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Brett, your 'Venture-Media' model is unique. Could you elaborate on how the Bulletpitch newsletter and events directly translate into deal flow and diligence for Bulletpitch+? What's an example of a company where this synergy was particularly evident, perhaps like POSH?" [2, 3, 6]</li>
                <li>"You've mentioned a shift from influencer marketing to 'pay-to-play.' How should pre-seed founders with limited budgets think about early customer acquisition and building a brand in this evolving media landscape?" [6]</li>
                <li>"You've highlighted the importance of a personal brand in VC. For founders, how crucial is their personal brand-building effort at the pre-seed stage, and what are effective ways they can approach this?" [11]</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Kate Shillo Beardsley (Hannah Grey):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Kate, Hannah Grey is 'thesis-led' and uses 'Culture Vibrations' to understand market shifts. Can you walk us through how a theme from Culture Vibrations, say 'The Rise of the Cozy Web' or 'Gen Z Money Dysmorphia,' might translate into a specific investment opportunity you'd pursue?" [17, 18, 21]</li>
                <li>"You look for 'customer-obsessed founders.' What does that look like in practice at the pre-seed stage, before there might be many customers? What questions do you ask or what signals do you look for to identify that deep customer empathy?" [17, 18, 65]</li>
                <li>"You advise founders to think 'four chess moves ahead' in fundraising. What's the most common pitfall you see pre-seed founders make in their initial round that impacts their ability to raise Series A or B effectively?" [28]</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Brent Willess (Founder Collective):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Brent, Founder Collective is 'deliberately anti-thematic.' How does this approach influence your evaluation of a pre-seed founder's pitch, especially if their idea is unconventional or doesn't fit current trends? What makes a 'weird & wonderful' idea compelling to you?" [30]</li>
                <li>"The philosophy of 'efficient entrepreneurship' – raising as little as possible – is central to Founder Collective. How do you advise founders on balancing the need for sufficient runway with the pressure to conserve equity at the pre-seed stage?" [30]</li>
                <li>"Given your background in strategy at Uber, what's one strategic framework or lesson from scaling a massive company that you find surprisingly relevant for founders at the very beginning of their journey?" [33]</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Naomi Goez (Forum Ventures):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Naomi, Forum Ventures specializes in B2B SaaS and acts as a 'fractional co-founder.' Could you give an example of how your accelerator program tangibly helps a pre-seed B2B SaaS company nail its early go-to-market strategy or achieve product-market fit?" [45]</li>
                <li>"You emphasize deep domain expertise and distribution advantages for founders. For a B2B SaaS startup targeting a niche market, how can founders best demonstrate these advantages to you, especially if they don't have a massive existing network?" [50]</li>
                <li>"Forum Ventures has an AI Venture Studio. What unique opportunities or challenges do you see for pre-seed founders building AI-native B2B SaaS products today, and what specific support does your studio offer?" [45, 47]</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Riley Finch (NextGen Venture Partners - nextgenvp.com):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Riley, NextGen Venture Partners highlights its 'VP Engine'—a network of over 1800 executives. Can you share a concrete example of how a pre-seed B2B startup in your portfolio has leveraged this engine for a critical breakthrough, be it a key hire, strategic partnership, or overcoming a specific challenge?" [58, 56, 59]</li>
                <li>"Your role involves sourcing and leveraging the VP network for diligence. When evaluating a pre-seed B2B company, how does access to this executive network shape your diligence process differently than perhaps a firm without such a structured resource?" [56]</li>
                <li>"NGVP invests from pre-seed up to growth stage for B2B companies. What are some common early indicators you look for in a pre-seed B2B SaaS company that suggest it has the potential to reach that $10M ARR threshold for your growth stage investments?" [58]</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion" class="conclusion">
            <h2>III. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The pre-seed funding landscape is diverse, with investors using varied strategies. Understanding these distinct philosophies—from Bulletpitch's media-first model and Hannah Grey's cultural trend analysis, to Founder Collective's anti-thematic approach, Forum Ventures' B2B SaaS specialization, and NextGen VP's network-driven support—is key for founders. This knowledge enables targeted outreach and a clearer understanding of potential partnerships, crucial for navigating early-stage fundraising.</p>
